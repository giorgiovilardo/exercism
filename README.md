## Ruby notes

* guard with `raise FooExc unless cond`
  * `unless` => `if not`, can be used as an expression?
* strings method `scan` seems interesting, it produces lists of matches but the regex you pass to it it's some sort of predicate which the currently in iteration char must satisfy
* `case` is not that capable, it's not pattern matching
